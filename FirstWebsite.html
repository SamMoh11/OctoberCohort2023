<h1>Meet Samsam: A Simple Introduction </h1>

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
   
<p>
Hello, lovely readers! Today, 
    I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself. 
    I believe in keeping things simple, 
    so let's get to know me in a straightforward way.

</p>

<h3>
 About me. </h3>
 <p>  
   My name is Samsam and I'm a final year medical student. I'm currently living in Sweden. 
   For years I've been searching for skills to invest in and coding has been something I've wanted to learn. I'm excited about joining recently
  a bootcamp called Pivot2Tech, where I will learn the fundamentals of Web development. 
  <br><br>
   <b>Here are some quick facts: </b>
   <br><br>


 <b>Hobbies</b>: In my free time you can find me going for an hour walk whilst listening to a podcast or a lecture.
 I also like watching football as growing up with only brothers
 have led to that. I support, unfortunately, Chelsea FC.
 Even though I don't really watch any tv shows or movies, I really love comedy tv shows. 
 My all time favorite comedy tv show is, and forever will be, 
 The Office (US version of course). 
   <br><br> 

<b> What inspires me</b>: I spent many years living in Somalia and that is where 
all my passion and drive for being the best version of myself mainly comes from. I 
never understood how privileged I was until I found myself far away from a western country 
to a country where the majority live in poverty.

   <br><br>

<b>Goals and Aspirations</b>: Honestly, there are so many of them. But in this text, I will highlight my main ones. Each one is very personal and dear to my heart. 
My most important one is that I hope to retire my mother in the near future. I also want to have the option of working remotely. Another goal is to build something 
that will live on after me and is for the people. As someone who has spent time at hospitals in Somalia and lived there as well, there are so many ways 
one could give back or lift up the society. My people back home have so much drive and passion to make it in life,
but the resources to reach some of their goals are limited in various aspects. I hope I get to 
be someone who provides to her people through services that are well needed in the society.
